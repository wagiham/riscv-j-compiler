# RISC-V J Compiler

A high-performance compiler that translates the J programming language into optimized RISC-V assembly.

## Features

- Advanced tokenization and parsing
- Efficient handling of nested control flow and function definitions
- Robust stack management and error handling
- Optimized assembly code generation for RISC-V architectures

## Getting Started
Project Structure
- jc.c / jc.h: Main compiler logic
- asm_gen.c / asm_gen.h: RISC-V assembly code generation
- token.c / token.h: Tokenization and parsing modules

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Make

### Building

Run:
```bash
make
